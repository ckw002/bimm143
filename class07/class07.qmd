Today we are going to learn how to apply different machine learning methods, beginning with clustering:

The goal here is to find groups/clusters in your input data.

First I will make up some data with clear groups. For this I will use the `rnorm()` function:

```{r}
rnorm(10)
```

```{r}
hist( rnorm(10000, mean = 3))
```

```{r}
n <- 10000
x <- c(rnorm(n, -3), rnorm(n, +3))
hist(x)
```

```{r}
n <- 30
x <- c(rnorm(n, -3), rnorm(n, +3))
y <- rev(x)

z <- cbind(x,y)
head(z)
```

```{r}
plot(z)
```

Use the `kmeans()` function setting k to 2 and nstart=20

Inspect/print the results

> Q. How many points are in each cluster?
      There are 60 points in each cluster. 

> Q. What 'component' of your result object details
      - cluster size?
      - cluster assignment/membership?
      - cluster center?
      Answered below. 

> Q. Plot x colored by the kmeans cluster assignment and add cluster centers as blue points.
      Answered below. 

```{r}
km <- kmeans(z, centers = 2)
km
```

Results in kmeans object `km`
```{r}
attributes(km)
```

Cluster size?

```{r}
km$size
```

Cluster Assignment/membership?

```{r}
km$cluster
```

Cluster center?

```{r}
km$centers
```

> Q. Plot x colored by the kmeans cluster assignment and add cluster centers as blue points.

```{r}
plot(z, col= "red")
```

R will re-cycle the shorter color vector to be the same length as the longer number od data points) in z

```{r}
plot(z, col= c("red","blue"))
```

```{r}
plot(z, col=c(1,2))
```

```{r}
plot(z, col=km$cluster)
points(km$centers, col = "blue", pch = 15, cex = 3)
```

> Q. Can you run kmeans and ask for 4 clusters please and plot the results like we have done above?

```{r}
km4 <- kmeans(z, centers = 4)
plot(z, col=km4$cluster)
points(km4$centers, col = "blue", pch = 15, cex = 3)
```

##Hierarchical Clustering 

Let's tke our same made-up data `z` and see how hclust works. 

First we need a distance matrix of our data to be clustered. 

```{r}
d <- dist(z)
hc <- hclust(d)
hc
```

```{r}
plot(hc)
abline(h=8, col="red")
```

I can get my cluster membership vector by "cutting the tree" with the `cutree()` function like so: 

```{r}
grps <- cutree(hc, h=8)
grps
```

Can you plot `z` colored by our hclust results:

```{r}
plot(z, col=grps)
```

##PCA of UK food data

Read data from the UK on food consumption in different parts of the UK

```{r}
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/UK-foods"
x <- read.csv(url, row.names=1)
head(x)
```

```{r}
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=F, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))
```

A so-called "Pairs" plot can be useful for small datasets like this one

```{r}
pairs(x, col=rainbow(10), pch=16)
```


It is hard to see structure and trends in even this small data-set. How will we ever do this when we have big datasets with 1,000s or 10s of thousands of things we are measuring...



### PCA to the resure 

Let's see how PCA deals with this dataset. So main function in base R to do PCA is called `prcomp()`

```{r}
pca <- prcomp( t(x) )
summary(pca)
```

Let's see what is inside this `pca` object that we created from running `prcomp()`

```{r}
attributes(pca)
```


```{r}
pca$x
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], 
  col=c("black", "red", "blue", "darkgreen"), pch=16,
  xlab="PC1 (67.4%)", ylab="PC2 (29%)")
```

## Lets focus on PC1 as it accounts for > 90% of variance 

```{r}
par(mar=c(10, 3, 0.35, 0))
barplot( pca$rotation[,1], las=2 )
```
